      <h4>Synopsis:</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Mister Yam - a twentysomething year Malaysian man disillusioned with corporate work in San Francisco - would
        find his life forever changed after an inexplicable phone call with a strange woman and an invitation to a
        musical show. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thus begins a series of events that would take Mister Yam chasing nameless figures across the
        country; solving a mystery only he can explain.</p>
      <br>

      <h4>Praise for Mister Yam:</h4>
      <br>

      <p>
        “In this debut novel…Tan’s cerebral novel is reminiscent of Haruki Murakami both in its structure and its
        dreamlike
        prose…The tale’s tone is charmingly offbeat.” <b><i>— Kirkus Reviews</i></b>
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> “It’s like the millennial’s version of a Burning Man revelations within one’s ho-hum life...There’s no one way
        to
        explain the deep message of Mister Yam, but reading it is a journey in itself; one that I highly encourage.”
        <b><i>— Musing Mystical</i></b>
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> “A spectacularly whimsical foray into the unknown…It is evident that Tan has relied upon a synthesis of
        influences to
        construct a narrative that is, all in all, extremely encompassing and engaging” <b><i>- Luna Khalil, Five Star
            Goodreads Review</i></b>

          <b>Yeng Tan </b> was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Growing up in a family of foodies, he developed an affinity for various cheeses and most salted delicacies found in a charcuterie board. He moved to the United States at the age of sixteen, studying engineering at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo before eventually settling in San Francisco. It was in the foggy city where Tan first began writing his debut novel, Mister Yam.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Tan cites Hermann Hesse, Haruki Murakami, and Agatha Christie as influences on his work - 
          and tangentially, James Hoffmann for his morning espresso.</p>
