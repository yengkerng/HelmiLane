      <br>
      <p>Mister Yam - a twentysomething year man disillusioned with corporate work in San Francisco - would
        find his life forever changed after an inexplicable phone call with a strange woman and an invitation to a
        musical show. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thus begins a series of events that would take Mister Yam chasing nameless figures across the

        “In this debut novel...Tan’s cerebral novel is reminiscent of Haruki Murakami both in its structure and its
        dreamlike
        prose...The tale’s tone is charmingly offbeat.” <b><i><a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/yeng-k-tan/mister-yam/">— Kirkus Reviews</i></a></b>
