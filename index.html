      <h4>Synopsis:</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Mister Yam - a twentysomething year Malaysian man disillusioned with corporate work in San Francisco - would
        find his life forever changed after an inexplicable phone call with a strange woman and an invitation to a
        musical show. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thus begins a series of events that would take Mister Yam chasing nameless figures across the
        country; solving a mystery only he can explain.</p>
      <br>

      <h4>Praise for Mister Yam:</h4>
      <br>

      <p>
        “In this debut novel…Tan’s cerebral novel is reminiscent of Haruki Murakami both in its structure and its
        dreamlike
        prose…The tale’s tone is charmingly offbeat.” <b><i>— Kirkus Reviews</i></b>
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> “It’s like the millennial’s version of a Burning Man revelations within one’s ho-hum life...There’s no one way
        to
        explain the deep message of Mister Yam, but reading it is a journey in itself; one that I highly encourage.”
        <b><i>— Musing Mystical</i></b>
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> “A spectacularly whimsical foray into the unknown…It is evident that Tan has relied upon a synthesis of
        influences to
        construct a narrative that is, all in all, extremely encompassing and engaging” <b><i>- Luna Khalil, Five Star
            Goodreads Review</i></b>

          <b>Yeng K Tan </b> was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Growing up in a family of foodies, he developed an
          affinity for various cheeses and most salted delicacies found in a charcuterie board. He moved to California
          at the age of sixteen, eventually settling in San Francisco. It was in the foggy city where Tan first began
          working on his debut novel, Mister Yam.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Tan’s writing has been
          characterized as mysterious, whimsical; psychedelic even. He attributes his offbeat prose to the uncanny
          experiences that have shaped his life while living in the United States - and the charming, bohemian-esque
          friends he interacts with on a daily basis. </p>
