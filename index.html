      <h4>Synopsis:</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Mister Yam - a twentysomething year man disillusioned with corporate work in San Francisco - would
        find his life forever changed after an inexplicable phone call with a strange woman and an invitation to a
        musical show. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thus begins a series of events that would take Mister Yam chasing nameless figures across the
        country; solving a mystery only he can explain.</p>

      <h4>Praise for Mister Yam:</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        “In this debut novel...Tan’s cerebral novel is reminiscent of Haruki Murakami both in its structure and its
        dreamlike
        prose...The tale’s tone is charmingly offbeat.” <b><i><a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/yeng-k-tan/mister-yam/">— Kirkus Reviews</i></a></b>
      </p>

      <p> “SHEEP. Bald man. A lost friend...they make the premise of an incredible story crafted by San Francisco-based Malaysian Yeng Tan.”

          <b>Yeng Tan </b> was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Growing up in a family of foodies, he developed an affinity for various cheeses and most salted delicacies found in a charcuterie board. He moved to the United States at the age of sixteen, studying engineering at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, before eventually settling in San Francisco. It was in the foggy city where Tan first began writing his debut novel, Mister Yam.

        <br>
        <p>Tan cites Hermann Hesse, Haruki Murakami, and Agatha Christie as influences on his work - 
          and tangentially, James Hoffmann for his morning espresso.</p>
